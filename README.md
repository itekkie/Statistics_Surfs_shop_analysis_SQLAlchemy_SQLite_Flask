## `Resources`	
The analysis was created using next resources:	
  - Data Source: [Resources](./Resources/).	
  - Software: Python 3.8.8, Pandas 1.2.4, Jupyter-notebook 6.3.0, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL 11.12 and pgAdmin 5.5.

## `Surf shop Analysis Summary`	

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. 

The analysis provides a lot of summarizing but the 3 can be chosen as main and essential business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Firstly, the analyse says the Urbun's average fare is the lowest. So, it points at the drivers are more than total rides taken. Therefore, it demands to decrease the drivers in Urban area. 

Next, in the same time, the Rural's fare is the biggest. So, Rural area should decrease their fare per ride to be more attractive for clients and to hire drivers more. But also, it can be that drivers drive longer distance. If so, it needs to attract more drivers it needs to organise marketing campaigns and others activities. 

Finally, Urbun area shows great trend by increasing their weekly fare income from January to April except 1 month from last week in Februaly till last week in March. So, that is perspective market for the company.
Additionally, comparing with Rural and Urban trend Suburban area shows unusual trend from last week of March to the end of April. It dsefinetly demands to have an additional analysis.
