## `Overview of the Surf shop Analysis`	
	
The purpose for the Surfs shop analysis is to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business sustainable year-round. 
The tasks of the Challenge are:
1. Retrieve all the temperatures for the 2 months of June and December. Convert the temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.
2. Write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.
## `Resources`	
The analysis was created using next resources:	
  - Data Source: [Resources](./Resources/).	
  - Software: Python 3.8.8, Pandas 1.2.4, Jupyter-notebook 6.3.0, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL 11.12 and pgAdmin 5.5.	
## `Surf shop Analysis Result`	
There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December

Full results can be found in the [SurfsUp_Challenge](./SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb) file.	
### ` - The difference (min, max, mean) in the summary statistics for the June and December temperatures`	

Based on the summary statistics for the June and December temperatures, the good temperatures are sustainable year-round the surf and ice cream shop business.
 
The not significant (less 5%) differences of the summary statistics display following:
  - mean is greater in June by almost 4&deg;F;
  - min is greater in June by almost 8&deg;F;
  - max is greater in June by almost 4&deg;F.

### ` - The difference (std) in the summary statistics for the June and December temperatures`

### ` - The third difference between the June and the December temperatures`	

Additionally, there is a difference between the June and the December temperatures as most of June's temperatures are between 71&deg;F - 81&deg;F comparing with December's temperatures: 65J&deg;F - 75&deg;F.

## `Surf shop Analysis Summary`	

The analysis provides a lot of summarizing and displays the main 3 differences between the June and the December temperatures:
- There are not significant (less 5%) differences of the summary statistics;
- The December's temperatures are volatile and often changeable between min and max;
- The  December's temperatures are colder comparing with June's temperatures approximately by 10&deg;F.

But the analyse of temperatures is not enogth for the opening the surf shop purpose.

The 2 can be chosen as main and essential business recommendations.
